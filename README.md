* What is it?
    * Binder, is a note taking app, that allows you to sort your notes based on the different subjects that you are taking. It allows this to happen, by letting the user input notes into a text box which then save to their own local storage. The app also has a small area, in which the user can input and specific word that they might want/need a definition for.
